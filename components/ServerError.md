# Server error

The server error is an empty state error page to be displayed when a server-side error has occurred.

## Best practices

You should create a route where merchants will be redirected to if a server-side error has occurred. This component can be rendered as the content's of that route's page.

## Examples

### Default behavior

```jsx
<ServerError />
```
