## Best practices

- Use table format to display features with onboarding either in progress or completed.
- Provide descriptions below the titles to remind merchants what the features are.
- List features in order of priority:
  1. Features with incomplete onboarding.
  2. Features that need attention or have errors.
  3. Features that have a next step or action (such as Create campaign, View campaign, View analytics etc.).
  4. Features that have no additional actions.
- Use badges to allow quick at-a-glance status of each feature (eg: setup in progress, ready, pending, etc).
- Use the space on the right for CTAs or if no action, additional info.
- For features with incomplete onboarding, use a progress bar with an approximate estimation of setup progress.
