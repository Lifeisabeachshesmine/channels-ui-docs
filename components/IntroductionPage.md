# Introduction page

An introduction page is a welcome screen of a channel. Its main goal is to help a merchant understand the value of the channel and choose the right starting point.

The structure of the page depends on the number of features a channel has to offer. Separate features allow merchants to choose a specific promotion or product placement they want to set up first. In a nutshell, a feature is a tool you offer merchants to interact with and succeed on your platform.

## Best practices

- If a channel offers access to an external marketplace, itâ€™s a single-feature channel. You can choose to have an intro page with a single large feature card to show the benefits of the channel or even no intro page at all.
- If a channel has a number of separate offers, it's a multiple-feature channel.
- Display a max of 3 features on the introduction page to avoid information overload.
- If merchants don't want to onboard onto any feature and just need to sync their products with the platform, consider adding a link to do that below the feature cards.
- Lead with free features or those that require less upfront financial investment.
