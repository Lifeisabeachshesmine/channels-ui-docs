# User experience principles

Channel UX principles are inspired by Shopify values and are at the core of how we build our channels.

---

## Principle 1: Efficiency

Help our merchants get set up as quickly as possible.

- Prefill as much information as possible or pull from Shopify APIs to make setup more efficient. For example, if we know their store name and the channel requires it, automatically fill that information in and just ask to confirm.
- Avoid the back-and-forth between your platform and Shopify wherever possible. Look for ways to allow merchants to complete tasks within Shopify.

## Principle 2: Trust

Build on the trust that Shopify has with our merchants.

- Be upfront and honest with merchants about requirements before they start using the channel. When a merchant is stuck, always provide a clear path forward or offer a solution.
- Introduce marketing and feature promotions so they don’t interfere with merchants completing their tasks.
- Adhere to honest, transparent business and commerce practices.

## Principle 3: Empowerment

Focus on helping merchants succeed with your channel.

- Build features that will give merchants a strong advantage and will ultimately help them succeed.
- Offer extensive guidance and support to help merchants onboard, manage, and discover new features.

---

## Principle 4: Consistency

Make it easy for merchants to use your channel.

- Make every part of the merchant’s workflow consistent with Shopify. Merchants don’t perceive a difference between Shopify and a specific channel.
- Create consistency with Shopify’s channel component library for marketplaces.
