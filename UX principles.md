# User experience principles

Channel UX principles are inspired by [Shopify experience values](https://polaris.shopify.com/foundations/experience-values) and are at the core of how we build our channels.

## Principle 1: Efficiency

Help merchants get set up as quickly as possible.

- Prefill as much information as possible or pull from Shopify APIs to make setup more efficient. For example, if you know a merchant's store name and the channel requires it, automatically fill that information in and just ask the merchant to confirm.
- Avoid the back-and-forth between your platform and Shopify wherever possible. Look for ways to allow merchants to complete tasks within the Shopify admin.

## Principle 2: Trust

Build on the trust that Shopify has with our merchants.

- Be upfront and honest with merchants about requirements before they start using the channel. When a merchant is stuck, always provide a clear path forward or offer a solution.
- Introduce marketing and feature promotions in a way that doesn’t interfere with merchants completing their tasks.
- Adhere to honest, transparent business and commerce practices.

## Principle 3: Empowerment

Focus on helping merchants succeed with your channel.

- Build features that will give merchants a strong advantage and will ultimately help them succeed.
- Offer extensive guidance and support to help merchants onboard, manage, and discover new features.

---

## Principle 4: Consistency

Make it easy for merchants to use your channel.

- Make every part of the merchant’s workflow consistent with Shopify. Merchants don’t perceive a difference between Shopify and a specific channel.
- Create consistency with [Shopify’s channel component library](https://github.com/Shopify/channels-ui-docs/tree/ux-content-guidelines#readme) for marketplaces.
